Requirements for MPS Server \u00b6 Software Requirements \u00b6 git node.js v10 or greater Hardware Requirements \u00b6 Activated Device with Intel\u00ae AMT Computer or device used to connect to MPS server Computer or device to connect the client console Supported Platforms \u00b6 The MPS server can run on all platforms that support node.js. One consideration is exposing ports on the server used to run MPS. Typically, these are: 3000 4433 MPS Server: Set Up \u00b6 The instructions below are performed on the MPS server. To begin, run a platform that supports nodejs. Example: Virtual Machine with nodejs support Dedicated Server with nodejs support Once the software pre-requisites are met for the MPS, you can begin the rest of the set up of MPS. 1. Clone the repository \u00b6 git clone https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/MPS.git cd MPS 2. Add/modify config.json \u00b6 Navigate to the private directory within the MPS directory, cd ~/MPS/private Create a config.json file. *Copy the example file in the directory. cp config.json.example config.json These following parameters can be configured. Option Description usewhitelist set to true to whitelist AMT GUIDs stored in guids.json commonName used in self signed certificate, can be either FQDN or IP address mpsport port mpsusername new username for mpsusername set during this current process mpspass new password for the user set during this current process useglobalmpscredentials When set to true, any device using mpsusername and mpspass in config.json are allowed to connect. When set to false, MPS validates credentials sent by AMT device using credentials.json. country name of country company name of company debug debug option set to true or false listenany listen to any set to true or false https set to true to enable TLS on HTTP server mpstlsoffload set to true to run MPS without TLS webport Port used by WebServer (or HTTP server) generateCertificates Generates certificates automatically. When set to true, SSL and Root cert are generated and stored in private folder loggeroff : Logging is enabled by default. Set to true to disable logging. mpusername and mpspass can be set to whatever credentials you choose to set, at this time. This will math the mpsusername and mpspass in other config files edited during this process. For example: { \"usewhitelist\" : false, \"commonName\": \"iot-demosetup.lab.local.com\", \"mpsport\": 4433, \"mpsusername\": \"standalone\", \"mpspass\": \"G@ppm0ym\", \"useglobalmpscredentials\": true, \"country\": \"US\", \"company\": \"NoCorp\", \"debug\": true, \"listenany\": true, \"https\": true, \"mpstlsoffload\": false, \"webport\" : 3000, \"generateCertificates\": true, \"loggeroff\": true } 3. Add/modify credentials.json \u00b6 If not in the ~/MPS/private directory, navigate to the private directory within the MPS directory. cp credentials.json.sample credentials.json AMT GUID Each AMT device has a unique identifier (GUID) assigned to it by default. This GUID will be used as the reference to each device record. To obtain the GUID on the AMT device, open a command prompt, navigate to where meshcmd.exe resides, and run meshcmd amtuuid . The GUID will display. Option Description name AMT hostname or user friendly identifier mpsuser AMT Device uses this as the user name while connecting to MPS. This is set once by the developer mpspass AMT Device uses this as the password while connecting to MPS. This is set once by the developer amtuser MPS uses this as the AMT user name when making AMT API calls (WSMAN or Redirection). This is the username set in the AMT configuration amtpass MPS uses this as the AMT password when making AMT API calls (WSMAN or Redirection). This is the password set during AMT configuration AMT and MPS password security recommendation Intel highly recommends that you don't use same password for MPS AMT. An example strong password would contain: at least eight characters at least one uppercase letter one lowercase letter one digit one special character For example: { \"8dad96cb-c3db-11e6-9c43-bc0000d20000\" : { \"name\" : \"Win7-machine\" , \"mpsuser\" : \"standalone\" , \"mpspass\" : \"G@ppm0ym\" , \"amtuser\" : \"admin\" , \"amtpass\" : \"G@ppm0ym\" }, \"bf49cf00-9164-11e4-952b-b8aeed7ec594\" : { \"name\" : \"Ubuntu-machine\" , \"mpsuser\" : \"xenial\" , \"mpspass\" : \"G@ppm0ym\" , \"amtuser\" : \"admin\" , \"amtpass\" : \"G@ppm0ym\" } } 4. Add/modify guids.json \u00b6 If usewhitelist is set to true in the config.json file, add a guids.json file in private directory to whitelist AMT GUIDs that are allowed to connect to MPS. Use guids.json.sample as an reference to create the guids.json and populate it with guids for whitelisting. This file is used to simulate whitelisting based on AMT GUIDs. Navigate to the ~/MPS/private directory. cd ~/MPS/private Create the guids.json file. cp credentials.json.sample credentials.json Edit this file to include your GUID(s). The GUID can be found using meshcommander. On the device with AMT activated, change to the directory where meshcmd.exe was downloaded. For example For example: [ \"8dad96cb-c3db-11e6-9c43-bc0000d20000\" , \"12345678-9abc-def1-2345-123456789000\" ] 5. Start the server \u00b6 Navigate to the MPS directory. Run the following commands: npm install npm start This will install all the dependencies and start the server. Webserver (or HTTPS server) runs on port 3000 by default and MPS Server listens on port 4433. Certificates are generated and stored in private folder. 6. Connect an AMT device \u00b6 Make sure the AMT device is connected to the internet. On the device, browse to the MPS server using the IP address or domain Example URL : https://MPS-IPaddress:3000 Click Download MESCRIPT . This will download a cira_setup.mescript file. MEScript MEScript files are used by MeshCMD to execute a series of actions on the AMT device. Next, locate the meshcommander.exe download previously. Browse to the folder where MEScript and MeshCMD are downloaded. Open an elevated or administrator command prompt or cli. Run the below command. This runs a script that does all the configuration required for CIRA setup. Specifies the root certificate that the Firmware (ME) should use for TLS negotiation. Specifies the login credentials that the Firmware should use when connecting to MPS. Specifies the periodic connection time the Firmware should use to maintain MPS connection. Specifies the home domain suffix used to enable environment detection (When device is outside the home domain, AMT uses CIRA to connect to MPS). meshcmd.exe amtscript --script cira_setup.mescript --pass <amt password> The device will now connect to the MPS Server. Device credentials Make sure that AMT guid entry is present in credential.json file. Also include the AMT guid in guids.json file if usewhitelist is set to true in config.json file.","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"#get-started","text":"The instructions in this document offers the following guidance: Set up the Management Presence Server Modify json configuration sample files Connect to an activated AMT device","title":"Get started"},{"location":"#overview-of-the-management-presence-server-mps","text":"The Management Presence Server is a cloud agnostic micro-service that enables Intel\u00ae AMT-based platforms connectng over the The image below is a representation of using MPS server connected to an activated AMT device.","title":"Overview of the Management Presence Server (MPS)"},{"location":"#requirements-for-mps-server","text":"","title":"Requirements for MPS Server"},{"location":"#software-requirements","text":"git node.js v10 or greater","title":"Software Requirements"},{"location":"#hardware-requirements","text":"Activated Device with Intel\u00ae AMT Computer or device used to connect to MPS server Computer or device to connect the client console","title":"Hardware Requirements"},{"location":"#supported-platforms","text":"The MPS server can run on all platforms that support node.js.
